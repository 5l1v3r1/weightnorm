# weightnorm

This is an implementation of [weight normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07868v3.pdf), an algorithm from OpenAI for improving the performance of SGD. My aim was to make this as general as possible, while still making it easy to use with "standard" network structures (e.g. a fully-connected layer).
